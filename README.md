# I Need Healing

This project is a game where we play as a healer, the objective is to heal our allies to defend the king from a horde of enemies.
To heal our buddies we can shoot heal orbs and we can use a buff zone to make them temporarily invulnerable.

We have 15 days to realize the project and was made with Unreal Engine. [![Unreal Engine](https://img.shields.io/badge/Unreal%20Engine-4.27.2-blue)](https://www.unrealengine.com)
